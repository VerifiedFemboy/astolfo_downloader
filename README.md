An Astolfo Downloader written in C++

The [old](https://github.com/VerifiedFemboy/AstolfoDownloader) was written in Java ☕, so this is **REWRITE**

# ⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ⚠️

## How it works ❓

When you start the program it automatically send request to an API called "https://astolfo.poligon.lgbt/api/"
and write random image to interface and shows a button which can be useful to download. (still unfinished xd)
